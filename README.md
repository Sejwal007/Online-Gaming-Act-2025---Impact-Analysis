# Online-Gaming-Act-2025---Impact-Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes the projected financial and strategic impact of the 2025 regulatory act on the Indian online gaming industry. The goal was to quantify the market shock and propose data-driven strategic pivots for companies affected by it.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Analysis:** SQL (MySQL)
- **Data Visualization:** Google Sheets
- **Database Management:** Schema Design, Data Insertion (DDL, DML)
- **Business Acumen:** Market Impact Analysis, Strategic Planning

## Key Findings & Dashboard

The analysis concluded that the act would cause an 86% market contraction, driven entirely by the collapse of the Real Money Gaming (RMG) sector.

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I proposed a two-phase strategy for affected companies:
1.  **Immediate Survival Steps:** Halt RMG operations, retain the user base with a free-to-play pivot, and implement Freemium, In-App Purchase (IAP), and Advertising (IAA) models.
2.  **Long-Term Vision:** Diversify the product portfolio through R&D, evolve into a comprehensive sports-tech platform, and pursue international expansion to mitigate regulatory risk.
